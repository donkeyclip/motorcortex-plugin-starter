 * The purpose of extending the HTMLClip is to full, parametric

 * 
 * HTMLClip allows you to set your html, css, fonts and audioSources
 * upfront by the corresponding getter methods. You can use the this.attrs
 * reference on these methods so you can generate dynamic content.
 * Overwrite ONLY the ones you are interested in, ignore the rest.
 * The buildTree method allows developers to define Incidents (of any plugin)
 * dynamically and position them on the Clip.
